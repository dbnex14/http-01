        // get chained like this.http.get(....).pipe(...).subscribe(...);, because pipe()

                // data and then to convert that data which is a JS object into an array, we
                // have to loop through it manually and get the key for each node returned.

                // this is because TS does not know anything about it other than that it is an 
                // object, but it does not know its type.  We can tell TS its bype by defining an
                // interface in post.model.ts file describing the object structure and then below

                // Angular http client get method is generic so instead of that, we can use that by
                // adding above generic portion in get() method.

                        // object from it and use spread (...) operator to pull out all the key/value 
                        // pair of that nested object, so for example title: 'Test' etc, and we also
                        // add another parameter id which is the key Firebase provide to us.
